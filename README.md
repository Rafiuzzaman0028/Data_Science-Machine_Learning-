# Real-time Object Detection Model using TensorFlow

This project implements a real-time object detection system leveraging TensorFlow's Object Detection API. The model is designed for live video streams and can detect multiple object classes efficiently, making it suitable for applications like surveillance, robotics, and more.

## Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Processes live video feeds with minimal latency.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Uses TensorFlow's pre-trained models like SSD or YOLO.
- **Customizable**: Easy to retrain for new object classes.
- **Visualization**: Outputs bounding boxes and labels on detected objects.

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rafiuzzaman0028/realtime-object-detection.git
   cd realtime-object-detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download or link a pre-trained TensorFlow model and place it in the `models/` directory.

4. Run the detection script:
   ```bash
   python src/detect.py
   ```

## Demo
Below is an example of real-time object detection:

## Usage
- Modify `src/detect.py` to adjust input sources (e.g., video file, webcam).
- Customize detection thresholds and classes in the code as needed.

## Results
- **High Accuracy**: The model detects objects in real-time with high precision.
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for smooth processing on supported hardware.

Example outputs:
- Bounding boxes drawn around detected objects.
- Real-time labels and confidence scores displayed on the video.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Future Work
- Add support for additional pre-trained models like Faster R-CNN.
- Optimize for edge devices like Raspberry Pi.
- Implement model training pipeline for custom datasets.
